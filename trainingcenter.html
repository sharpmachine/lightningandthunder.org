<h1>Lightning and Thunder Supernatural Training Center in Iowa</h1>

<h2 style="color: #000;">Matthew 10:7-8<br \>
And as you go, preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick. Cleanse the leper, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received freely give.</h2>

<p>In 2005 the Lord gave us a vision and spoke clearly to us... to build supernatural training centers.  We are now hearing Him say," now is the time to build one at home.  The vision has begun right here in our home with a gathering.  We are excited about a move of God, that will bring the Kingdom of God into not only our small community but to the region.</p>
