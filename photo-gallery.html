    <h2>MISSIONS</h2>
    <p>Lighting & Thunder Ministry have a vision for seeing the Kingdom of God advanced on the earth by setting the captives free and living in the light of God’s Word.  Our heart for the mission field as is to see the lost saved, healed and delivered through the power of the Holy Spirit. When we go into a foreign nation, we go in with the power of the Gospel, speaking prophetic decrees that break curses and cultural strongholds over regions.</p>

<div class=verse><p>Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. - Mark 16:15</p></div>

      <h2>Uganda</h2>
      
     <div>
      	 <a href="images/photo-gallery/uganda/Kampala Open Market.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Kampala Open Market"><img src="images/photo-gallery/thumbs/uganda/Kampala Open Market.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Kampala Open Market"></a>
      </div>
      
       <p>Uganda is one of the world’s poorest countries, with one half of the population of 30,900,000 living under the poverty line with under a daily income of $1.25. HIV is prevalent but the numbers are decreasing.  The country hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering 235,800 from surrounding countries.</p>
<p>In 2005 we traveled to Uganda to preach at a crusade. We had plans to go up to the northern part of the country, but were told by the officials of the country that the crusade could no longer be held there because the rebels had moved in. The crusade plans were moved to the small city of Soroti. </p>
<p>Having the desire to see souls saved and the sick healed, we ministered in the power of the Holy Spirit. We saw many children come to the Lord there, along with adults. Dick felt led to go down into the crowd and prophetically minister one on one, and many were healed. </p>
<p>A young man was in the crowd and came forward for deafness.  Dick had a word from the Lord for him to go home and go to bed, and in the middle of the night his ear would pop and he would hear. The young man came back to the crusade the next night hearing and gave testimony to the healing power of God.</p>
<p>The next year we went back to Uganda, only this time to the city of Kampala.  Kampala is a huge city full of vehicles that travel side by side. Being caught in a traffic jam is Kampala is not our idea of a good time.  However the people there are very kind and gracious.</p>
<p>Kampala is a city with many churches, yet like in most places there are many people that do not have Christ.  In most of the churches in Africa there are many people who go to church but are not born again. For them it is normal to attend a Christian church and visit witch doctors as well.  There is a great need to preach and to teach the uncompromisable word of God.</p>
<p>To reach the unreached is always our calling. This crusade was held in a dump that had been cleared and cleaned up enough to hold a platform and for the people to come. The area was close to the red district of the city and was a great location for reaching the people as they passed by. God was faithful as always and we saw many saved and healed as we both preached and prayed for the needs of the people. One night it seamed there was such unity of the people as they all cried out together for the fire of God to fall upon them and fill them with His Holy Spirit. Again there were many pulled out of the pit of destruction that said “Yes!” to Jesus.</p>
<p>Saved, cleansed and made whole, Jesus shows up and touches the needy. A deaf little boy heard. A baby with fever was healed.  Two ladies with stomach problems were made well, and many manifested miracles took place.</p>

      <h2>Democratic Republic of the Congo</h2>
      
      
      
      
      
<p>There are 66,020,000 people in the Congo. 
<p>The 1st Congo War started in 1996 and the 2nd in 1998.  The latter war ended in 2003, but resulted in over 5 million deaths which has consequently dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, thus increased external debt. Also as a result of the war 5.2 million children are uneducated.  In 1998 the gross enrollment rate was at 50%.</p>
<p>Currently malnutrition affects nearly 2/3rds of the population, and the country is experiencing an AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>As we led the team into the “no man’s land” between the countries of Zambia and the Republic of Congo, there was a spiritual difference in the atmosphere.  After passing through the customs offices we were met by some Congolese Christian men who escorted us on to the city of Lubumbashi.  Jungle trees lined the highways and the spiritual atmosphere became heavier.</p>
<p>As we moved onto the grounds of the crusade site we sensed the heaviness of spiritual darkness left from the conflicts of war and the level of need in the land.  Dick immediately became aware of the religious spirits that needed to be broken off of the city and the country.</p>
<p>During the daytime we held conferences for the women and the youth.  Holding a four night crusade on the grounds of a soccer field, that produced hundreds of salvations and many, many healed and delivered.</p>
<p>In the day we held conferences for the women and children.  In the night we held crusades in a soccer field.  This went on for four days, producing hundreds of salvations and many people healed and delivered.  For four days we saw God's hand working among these people. </p>
<p>A women who couldn't give birth to a live baby  came forward for Dick to pray for her. After she went home that night she passed out of her body a rag that a witch doctor had put inside of her four years prior.  The blood of Jesus conquered the curse of the witch doctor. </p>
<p>After praying for a women with a cancerous cyst on her breast, the cancer burst and fell off that night. The next night she came forward to show the baby smooth skin where the cyst had been.</p>
<p>Many more miracles and healings took place.  The lame walked, marriages were restored and many added to the church of Jesus Christ, just as the Word of God promises. </p>

      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent" id="tanzania">
      <h2>Tanzania</h2>
      <p>Tanzania holds much beauty and diversity. From Mt. Kilimanjaro to the very hot and dry desert. The basin of the Nagoragora and the Serengeti are full of migrating animals that bring many tourists for safaris and hunts. But the people of Tanzania are in poverty and the death rate is very high. Tanzania has a population of approx. 40,000,000 people.  The life expectancy is a mere 50 years old. The leading cause of death for children is malaria and with the adults it is AIDS.  The number of Christians in the country is growing, but about a third of the population is Muslim.</p>
<p>We have made two trips to this beautiful country to minister and hold crusades in the city of Arusha. God’s grace is always sufficient and we are overwhelmed by His power and faithfulness. A deaf mute girl spoke (made noise) and heard for the first time after the deaf mute spirit was cast out of her. Many were healed of various diseases and hundreds came to the alter for salvation. During the last crusade we held an angel of the Lord passed thought the crowd and people were falling down under the power in the back of the crowd after being touched by God’s goodness. Dick had a word of knowledge that there was a young boy somewhere close to the crusade grounds that had a swollen head. He asked anyone who knew this boy to come forward. A young lady came and said, “This is my neighbor boy.” So Dick laid hands on that girl and prayed for the boy who was at home. The report came to us after we returned home that many in that city went to his home to see the miracle, as the boys head had been made normal by the wonderful healing power of God.  There are many stories to tell not only of the goodness of God in the crusades, but also of the Pastors Conferences as the Word of God goes forth with new and fresh revelation.</p>
<p>We were able to pray for a widows with AIDS in a small church in the desert land, as well as a deformed boy that was born fine, but his mother had taken him to a witch doctor as a baby and he had been getting more crippled ever since. We were also able to visit the orphanages and pray for the children there.</p> 
<p>We have had some adventures on our travels. We traveled up into the hills to the Masai village to show the Jesus film.  That was a chilly night sleeping in the tents! But it was worth it as we gave an alter call for salvation in the middle of the movie. On the screen held in still frame, was Jesus hanging on the cross.  This helped to paint the vivid picture that Jesus gave His life for them.  We prayed for many that night.</p> 
<p>After all the ministry was done we took a Safari.  While jeeping through the beautiful African landscape, we got our jeep stuck in the Nagoragora Crater!  It too about 12 to 15 men to rock the jeep out of the water and mud, but God did not leave us there with the wild animals.  We made our escape as we sang praises to God all the way back up out on a narrow winding road in the rain to the other side of the mountain. What an adventure!</p></div>
      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent" id="zambia">
      
      <h2>Zambia</h2>
      <p>Zambia is an official Christian nation, but the poverty level is high with 60% under the poverty line. The average wage is $1.25 per day. Of late the price of copper has plummeted and the economy has come to a stand still.  The most devastating thing that we have seen besides the poverty is the high rate of AIDS.  One out of every five adults are infested with HIV.</p>
<p>In 2003 God connected us with Pastor Stanley Nsofwa and his wife Towellah from Zambia right in our little church in Fairfield, Iowa. They invited us to their country and in that same year we held a Crusade in Chingola, a town in the copper belt region.</p>
<p>The first crusade was small and a new beginning for us. God's word tells us not to despise small beginnings. We were just doing our best to be humble servants of God. With a small team of four we were on an adventure for God, expecting great and mighty things to take place. We witnessed the power of God as the young and old came to Jesus Christ. People were healed and set free.</p>
<p>During a time of ministry Dick had a word of Knowledge that there were three people not in there right mind, but that the Lord wanted to heal them. Three people came to the alter and he prayed the prayer of deliverance over them. We believe that they all were healed. But the next day as we finished ministering to the sick at a small hospital, we crossed the road to to get a drink at a Coca Cola stand. A women who recognized Dick came up to him and wanted him to know that the night before when he called people forward not in their right mind, that one of them he prayed for was her daughter. This girl in her early teens was standing there with her mom as she told us this testimony. Her daughter is now saved and in her right mind. Praise God ! As we stood there listening to this joyful mother and daughter we noticed that the mom was totally blind in one eye. It was all milky white, but when we prayed for her and as the power of God came upon her, we watched the veins start to come forth and color came into her eye. What a marvelous thing to witness as she began to see.</p> 
<p>What a blessing it is to do street ministry, to lead people to Jesus, to pray for HIV victims. So many people are sick and needing set free from demonic spirits.  As we go out into the streets praying for people, God meets them at the point of their needs.</p>
<p>We have been blessed to be a part of a training school for pastors where 10 pastors are now getting their Master degrees. Also we have join hands with Stanley and Towellah as they started the Agape Land School for children.  The school started in a small house that they fixed up in the poorest part of the city. As the attendance of children grew they rented a larger facility, while still keeping the smaller one running. Now they have built a complex that educates over 100 students. Many of these children are unschooled orphan street children.  However because the economy is in shambles  right now, they are finding it difficult to pay teachers and maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>God moves in unexpected ways.  We now have 21 churches under the covering of Lightning &amp Thunder Ministry in Zambia. We continue to visit the churches and to minister the word of God.</p>
<p>If you have a heart to minister to, train up, and be a blessing to the people of Zambia, please consider donating to Lighting &amp Thunder Ministry.  You are also welcome to join us on the mission field.</p>

      <h2>India</h2>
       <p>India has a population of 1,147 billion people with the percentage of Christians
at only 2.5%. The most dominant religion in India today is Hinduism.  About 82% of Indians are Hindus, about 12% are Islam, 2% are Sikh and Judaism is about 0.0005%.  India is in great need of the gospel. The poverty level is high and AIDS  is on the rise.  In some areas of India there is great persecution against Christians from Hindu and Islam radicals, to the point of  burning homes and churches to the ground. Believers are being killed by stoning around the country, even small children are victims.  God is looking for harvesters to go and reap the harvest in this country.</p>
