	<h1>Zambia Update</h1>

	<p>We are moving ahead in Zambia, Africa. The land is now prepared for the Lightning &amp; Thunder Supernatural Training Center to go up!</p>
	<p>This building will also house a school for 100 children. After 80 children are enrolled the school will be self sufficient and will be able to take in 20 orphans to be schooled.</p>
	<p>Zambia, Africa was the first country Lightning and Thunder Ministry traveled to in 2003. In 2010 we partnered with Pastor Alfred Nsofwa in the kamwala south urban district in the capital city of Lusaka.</p>

	<p>At this time a home for security guard in being built, and the land has been leveled up for building. The electric line has now been made available with the pole and also water lines are ran. PROGRESS IS UNDERWAY!</p>
