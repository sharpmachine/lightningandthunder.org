<p>L&amp;T Ministry was launched in 2003 with founders Dick and Rose Kessler.  Having it's foundation in Rev. 4:5: "And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices.  Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God”.</p>

<p>Our Mission:</p>
<div class="verse">As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. - Matthew 10:7 &amp; 8</div>

<p>In the midst of a revival service Dick and Rose were desperately crying out to God, seeking a deeper walk with Him.  Dick went to the altar and the power of God hit him.  While under the power of the Holy Spirit God took him up in a vision.</p>
<p><em>“As I was standing beside Jesus, He was catching lightning bolts and throwing them to the earth. Everywhere lightning hit the ground, a ball of fire would explode from the earth. After Jesus did this several times I asked Him what this meant. He said revival will break out everywhere the lightning hits. As Jesus turned and looked at me smiling, He caught another bolt of lightning. We both looked and I saw myself laying on the floor in the revival meeting. Jesus threw the lightning bolt down and it hit my body with a jolt. The vision ended with the lightning of God vibrating my body across the floor.”</em></p>
<p>During this time, a word was spoken over Dick and Rose which confirmed the calling God had for their lives. Lightning and Thunder Ministry was birthed that night.</p>

<p>God has given Dick and Rose the vision to see Gods word preached everywhere they go, equipping pastors in conferences, and training up the saints to be disciples.  Putting a high priority on James 1:27: "Pure and undefiled religion before God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world".  It is a call to this ministry to be a "sound" in the earth, that brings joy to the Fathers heart.</p>

<p>Lightning and Thunder Ministry is a non profit, non denominational tax exempt ministry, under the covering of World Ministry Fellowship Plano, Texas</p>

        <h2>About Dick &amp; Rose</h2>
<strong>Together...</strong>

<p>Dick and Rose have rocked the nations of  Africa and India with the life-saving and miracle working message of the Kingdom of God.  They have held crusades in areas where others will not go, and where the people are hearing the good news of the Kingdom for the first time.  They relentlessly declare and decree freedom from bondage and curses over areas and states.  The result has been thousands saved, miraculous healings and the captives being set free.</p>
<strong>Rose</strong>
<p>Rose grew up on a small dairy farm in rural Iowa. She was born in 1946, the youngest of 6 children.  Her parents worked hard to keep the farm and make a living. Having had a call on her life from God at a young age, the enemy came to rob the future hope and life that God had destined for her.</p>
<p>Despite her happy childhood she was missing the love that was needed from her busy parents. She had a void that only God could fill, and she looked for love in all the wrong places. She married at a young age and had four sons in a period of seven years. Her third son was born with a heart defect and died after 21 days. Still God showed Himself faithful to her even though she was not living her life for Him. </p>
<p>For as long as she could remember she had attended a little Baptist church. At the age of 8 she had gone forward during an evangelistic meeting and had repeated a prayer and was baptized in water.  If anyone were to try and tell her she was not saved, she would have fought for her belief that she was. However at the age of 23, during her rocky marriage she came to the place of surrendering her life to the Lord. She became born again with a simple, but heart wrenching prayer of “Lord I have made a mess of my life, you take it.” And He did!  It was then that she knew that the act of going forward as a child was an acknowledgment of Jesus and the work of the cross but had not made Him Lord of her life. Now that she was born again, for the first time she was able to see and experience the leading of the Lord in her life.</p>
<p>In 1974, after several years of hungering for more of God, she was finally filled with the Holy Spirit. While washing her hair the powerful rivers of life flowed from her innermost being with tongues of the unlearned. It was powerful, miraculous and supernatural experience! God became so alive and real for the first time. God’s still small voice and the operation of the gifts of the Spirit were flowing in her life and ministry. With the heart’s desire to share and teach others of the experience that she had, she held Bible studies and prayer meetings in her home.</p>
<p>For the first 5 years of walking in the Spirit, the Lord would take her into a vision every time that she would sit down and get quiet. She would feel the stirring and presence of the Holy Spirit come upon her.  It was always the same vision. She would see herself ministering the Word of God from a pulpit with the gift of the word of Knowledge going forth calling people out of the audience with sicknesses and brokenness to come for God’s touch of healing. With this confidence she would witness and share Christ with those God placed in front of her.</p>
<p>There were also many trials happening in her life.  In 1983 her middle son was facing criminal charges, incarcerated for several months and sentenced to prison.  At the same time her marriage of 23 years was coming to an end. But nevertheless, God was elevating her above the circumstance to walk in the realm of the Kingdom as she fasted and prayed.  Great is His faithfulness to those who believe. </p>
<p>After being single and living in Tulsa, Oklahoma for 2 years, Rose was prepared to live her life and serve Him alone, but He had a planned surprise for her!  </p>
<strong>Crossroads</strong>
<p>One evening as she was praying the Holy Spirit spoke: “Go home and be with your parents for awhile.” After a month of struggling with this she gave notice at her job and moved back to Iowa. Within a few weeks she reunited with old friends at the church she had been attending. One of them was a younger guy named Dick that she had known for about four years. God had a plan for these two, who had both committed their lives to serving him. One day the young man invited her to ride with him to his father’s house. There in the drive way the Lord spoke to that man, “Rose is going to be your wife.” He responded with laughter, and “Lord she is my sister in You not anything more, but if this is Your will You will have to propose for me.  I am not going to!” One night the following week, as she was about to fall asleep the Lord spoke to her, “Dick is going to be your husband.” Getting up the next morning she went to the farm where she was raised and sat on the old well platform and said, “Lord, was that you last night?”  At that instant God dropped into her heart a love for Dick, and from that moment the deal was sealed. WOW! When God does something, it is a supernatural event!</p>
<p>It was a very long and interesting night when they got together to share what God was speaking to each of them. They finally got the secret out, and it was hilarious! Both knowing that God had surprised them, and it seemed like he was playing a joke on them. As they spread the news the laughter continued, as they told each and everyone about uniting their lives. It was a God happening!</p>
<strong>Dick</strong>
<p>Dick Kessler has been described as a lightning rod, as the power of God flows through him to minister healing to the sick and set the captives free. An encounter with Jesus Christ in a vision where he was struck by the lightning power of God left him a vessel full of the fire of God. </p>
<p>Dick's life story shows the supernatural working of God in the life of the unbeliever.  Time an time again God showed himself in ways of protection and visible signs along the way to let him know there was a God in heaven who loved him even while he was still living his life for himself.  Dick has been electrocuted, survived multiple car wrecks, and almost froze to death in the midst of a winter storm. During his years of rebellion in the 70's, he was involved in drugs and had become an alcoholic.  Nevertheless he had visitations from angels that protected him.</p>
<p>Dick was born in 1951 in the small farming community of Rubio, Iowa. Being raised on a farm allowed lots of time for adventure. At the age of 6 as he was attempting to climb into a tree he grabbed hold to the wiring on the pole that had been taped with electric tape and a fuel pipe at the same time. His little body was thrust out into the middle of the gravel driveway about 50 feet, landing on his hands and knees. The watchful eye of the Lord kept him safe as he did not have one scrape or scratch on him. He doesn't even remember ever feeling any pain. As he looks back over his life he is very aware of the Lord protection.</p>
<p>He had angels that spared his life on many occasions. When he was a teenager the presence of an angel appeared to him in a bad wreck he was involved in. His car was wrapped around a high line pole.  He should have been injured badly if not killed. The presence of God was there.</p>
<p>Being raised going to church on Sunday mornings placed seeds of God’s Word in him. He was aware that God existed in heaven and that Jesus had died for his sins  But it wasn't until the age of 28 after having his marriage fail, his finances in ruin, alcohol taking its toll and under the cloud of depression and suicide, that he knew he had no hope but to cry out to Jesus.</p>
<p>At this low place in his life he went to the river bank and cried out to God for help. God heard his cry. The sky was immediately bluer and the trees greener. Animals came up closer to him because the predator spirit was lifted as a squirrel came and set by him.</p>
<p>In 1981 he was still struggling with alcohol when he was invited to church by an old friend. On that first visit to church he was prayed for.  Right then and there he was delivered and set free from all addictions.</p>
<p>Seeing the supernatural power of God in operation he has never turned back, but has pursued God with his whole heart. God had spared him, saved him, called him and filled him with His Holy Spirit. From the first day of his salvation he has desired to see the lost souls saved, the sick healed and the oppressed to be set free.</p>
<strong>Currently...</strong>

<p>Dick and Rose were married on July 20th, 1985 and have been married 24 years.  Together they have five children, 11 grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.

Rose is a pastor and teacher with the gift of prophesy working in her life, with a heart for Africa. After walking on the red soil, the calling is loud and clear and runs deep in her spirit.</p>

        <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
<ul>
<h2>GOD IS LOVE AND HE DESIRES THAT ALL MEN BE RESTORED TO HIM</h2>


<li>There is one God, existing eternally in three persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.      <em>John 10:30; John 14:26; Philippians 2:5-7</em></li>

<li>Man is created in the image of God but separated from God by sin. Without Jesus we cannot have a relationship with God.    <em>Genesis 1:26; 1 Timothy 2:5</em></li>

<li>God is Love and He loves all people. It is His desire to reach out to those who are poor, oppressed, widowed or orphaned, and to heal the brokenhearted.  <em>Psalm 68:5,6; 1 John 4:16</em></li>

<h2>SALVATION IS FOR EVERYONE</h2>

<li>We can have a personal relationship with God through salvation, God's free gift to man. It is not a result of what we do, but it is only available through God's unearned favor. By admitting we have sinned and believing in the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, and accepting Him as Lord, we can spend eternity with God.       <em>Ephesians 2:8,9; Romans 5:1; Romans 3:24 John 14:6; Romans 10:9&amp;10</em></li>

<li>Sanctification is the ongoing process of allowing God's character to be developed in us. <em>Romans 6:19; Galatians 5:22-25</em></li>

<h2>BAPTISM IN WATER</h2>

<li>Water baptism, is taught and demonstrated by Jesus, as the way for believers to identify with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. <em>Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Matthew 3:13-17</em></li>

<h2>BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>

<li>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a gift from God. He helps empower the believer to develop the character of Christ and live every day in God's will.        <em>Matthew 3:11; Acts 2:4<</em>/li>

<li>God gives all believers spiritual gifts. They are for the strengthening of God's people (the Church) and proof of God's existence and power to unbelievers. The gifts of the Spirit are active and relevant today.       <em>1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 1 Peter 4:10</em></li>

<h2>GOD STILL HEALS TODAY</h2>

<li>Divine healing is active in the lives of people today through Jesus, who is the Healer. Healing includes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual restoration. <em>Luke 9:11; Matthew 9:35; Acts 10:38; Matthew 10:1</em></li>

<h2>JESUS WILL RETURN</h2>

<li>Jesus will return and take all those who have accepted Him as Savior to heaven for eternity. <em>Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17; Hebrews 9:28</em></li>

<p>SALVATION IS AS EASY AS ASKING JESUS THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, TO FORGIVE YOU OF YOUR SINS AND ASK HIM TO COME INTO YOUR HEART AND LIFE. HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR YOU BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU.</p>

        <div align="center">
        	<h3>LET THE LIGHTNIG FLASH &amp; THE THUNDER ROLL</h3>
<p>When you see the lightning flash<br \>
Splitting open the blackened sky<br \>
Receiving all of it's power<br \>
From the Lord God on high</p>
 
<p>Stand and wait a few seconds<br \>
You'll hear the thunder roll<br \>
Building in intensity<br \>
Until it vibrates your very soul</p>
 
<p>They always work together<br \>
Performing side by side<br \>
Getting guidance and direction<br \>
Using the Holy Spirit as their guide</p>
 
<p>Giving as freely as they've recieved<br \>
Sharing what God would have them say<br \>
Gathering souls around the world<br \>
Showing others the truth, the light, the way</p>
 
<p>Striking in the hearts of people<br \>
A fire burning in their bones<br \>
Sharing their desire to follow Jesus<br \>
Knowing He'll never leave them alone</p>
 
<p>Not afraid of satan<br \>
Even when he pours on the heat<br \>
They stand on the Word<br \>
And put him under their feet</p>
 
<p>United in one body<br \>
Join them in their stand<br \>
Together we'll send the gospel<br \>
All across this great land.</p>
