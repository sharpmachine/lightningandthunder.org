<h1>Zambia, Kenya and Rwanda Africa Trip Recap</h1>

<h2 style="color: #000;">Zambia - Feb. 15th – 19th</h2>

<p>Richard, Rose and our missionary friend Roger returned to Zambia for the 5th time. The main purpose for this trip to Zambia was to see the land and the security wall that had been constructed on the property where the Lightning and Thunder Ministry Supernatural Training Center will be built. Included within the walls of the Center will be rooms to school 100 children.  The training center itself will be used to train and equip the body of Christ and be a training center for pastors and leaders. It will also be a Conference Hall.  This property also is the church site for Pastor Alfred church “God’s Sanctuary International” that is under the covering of Lightning and Thunder Ministry.</p>

<p>We left home on Feb,13 and arrived in Lusaka, Zambia at 1:30 a.m. on the 15th.  We had taken with us a keyboard for worship in Pastor Alfred’s church.  We also took a welder and other equipment to start building the training center and school.</p>

<p>We were grateful for LTM Africa Administrator Pastor Alfred Nsofwa who was there to greet us, with some helpers to help with our luggage.  At this time we are in the process of leveling the land for the building sight. The next phase will be building a small home for grounds keeper and security guard. Then we will begin building the Training center that will be a large enough structure that it will have the school class rooms in it.</p>
      
<p>Our Pastor Conference and meetings were anointed as many received prayer and lives were touched and healed. The prophetic words flowed through Richard to the people, and the worship was great as it always is in Africa.</p>

<h2 style="color: #000;">Nairobi, Kenya - Feb. 20th</h2>

<p>We flew from Lusaka to Nairobi for a one night revival fire meeting.  Two wonderful Pastors picked us up at the airport and took us to the campus of the East Africa School of Theology an Assembly of God Bible College. There were many hungry worshipers, primed for fire anointing, awaiting our arrival. The faith level could be felt and many received from the Holy Spirit of God. What a wonderful service. After the meeting they fed us the most wonderful meal and Richard had the privilege of praying for the pastors children and blessing them.  What sweet spirited and open vessels of God.  We bless Pastor Isaya, Pastor Jeff and Pastor Moses.</p>

<h2 style="color: #000;">Kigali, Rwanda - Feb. 21st - 27th</h2>

<p>What a blessing it was to us to return to Kigali and see the Foursquare Church of Rwanda building finished. When we were there in 2009 and 2010 it was still an unfinished shell with no windows or doors in the openings, and a dirt floor.  Now it is a beautiful building and sanctuary.</p>

<p>During the time we were in Kigali they were holding the Foursquare National Leaders Conference. There were national leaders from 8 different nation of east Africa, as well as the Leader over all the nations of Africa that had flown in from Cape Town.</p>

<p>Richard preached revival meetings in the evenings and Sunday morning service, sharing the 12 prophetic words that God had given him for 2012. One of the 12 words was that this year would be a year of recovery. After three days a women in the church, named Aline that had property taken away from her received her property back. Other testimonies of recovery have been reported. The prophetic words spoken were encouraging and uplifting. God’s grace and faithfulness is never ending.</p>
