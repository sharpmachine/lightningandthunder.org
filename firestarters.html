<p><strong>FIRESTARTERS</strong> has been traveling throughout   Minnesota and the mid west for several years,   calling this generation to pursue the Lord with passion and purity. </p>
<p>God is   pouring out on His Body a level of creativity that we have not seen since the   Renaissance. Blending anointed musicianship with extravagant worship and the   arts, Firestarters is a model of a new sound and a new way. </p>
<p>Our   desire is to see a reformation within the church, with love being the driving   force behind this second Jesus people movement. We are calling fathers and sons,   mothers and daughters, the young and the old to come together in worship. This   love revolution is our only hope in radically impacting our state, nation and   world.</p>
<p>and Living Stones Fellowship   (Fairfield)   will host <strong>FIRESTARTERS</strong> November 21st at the Sondheim Center and Lightning and Thunder Ministry will be hosting Ottumwa, Iowa  at the Bridgeveiw Center on   November 24th. A   free will offering will be taken up. </p>
