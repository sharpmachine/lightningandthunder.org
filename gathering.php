<p><strong>Pastor Peter Ndikumana</strong>  was born and raised in Rwanda, Africa. He did not have a personal relationship with God until in 1994 at the age of 13 when he witnessed the Tutsi genocide. At that time about 800,000 people lost their lives. When at the point he was going to die along with his father and uncle, Peter made a vow to God that if God would save his life, he would serve and give Him the rest of his life. Peter believes that his life was spared for taking the Kingdom message to all peoples. In the past 6 years he has served as Pastor and General Secretary in his home church in Kigali. He was a consultant for International Adoptions in Rwanda and also on the Executive Board for the International Reconciliation Ministries for prison ministry. Peter, his wife Ruth and children now live in the United States. He is honored to be a part of these life changing meetings and speak to the people in Iowa.</p>

<p><strong>Pastor Bill Chilcote</strong> and his wife Ann are the Founders and Pastors of My Father’s House International in McConnellsburg, Pa. Bill is a prophetic revivalist at heart, a passionate lover of God with a desire to experience intimacy with the Father and to bring others into an encounter with Father God. This Kingdom teaching has impacted many people with a life changing encounter and a fresh passion in their hearts for more of a relationship with the Holy Spirit. People are taught to live in His power and presence, beholding Him.
Bills passion is: There is only one thing that I desire, to be in His presence and behold His beauty.</p>

<p><strong>Pastor Jacques Bagaza</strong> is not only Senior Pastor of Zion Temple Celebration Center in Rock Island, Il. but he is also an anointed worship leader. In the summer of 2012, he released his first album called:
"Ijwi Ryiza”. He has been a blessing to many as he travels numerous places to share his anointed music, selling his album around the world. Through wisdom, passion and commitment Pastor Jacques is seeing his church grow in all areas: spiritually, emotionally and physically. Jacques has come to America from the Congo with his wonderful wife and they have three children.
Many things can be said about Pastor Jacques, but one thing many will agree on, that his anointing cannot be hidden and he has been chosen remarkably by the Lord.</p>
