<p>The Lightnings of His Power and the Thunderings of His voice</p>
<p><strong>PART 1</strong></p>
<p>For the first teaching on our new website I thought it would be good to give understanding of why a ministry would be called Lightning &amp Thunder.  Some people just look blank and others are confused at the name. Every now and then someone lights up with understanding of what the Word has to say about it. But until Dick was taken up in a vision where Jesus was thrusting lightning bolts to the earth, I did not know what the Word had to say about the lightnings and thunders of God. (For a complete testimony of Dicks vision read the “<a href="aboutus.html">About Us</a>” section on this site.)</p>
<p>Let me begin by saying that our ministry scripture is found in Rev. 4:5. John, after being taken up into a vision saw the  door of heaven standing open to him.  He proceeded to give us an awesome picture of the beauty and activities of heaven.</p>
<p><em>“And from the Throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and a voice. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God”</em> I like the way that the Amplified Bible says it: <em>“Out of the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and pearls of thunder,”</em> How awesome is that?</p>
<p>I will not pretend to know it all, but I do want to share with you some of the scripture that back up the significance of the use of this title. I was amazed as I began to find scripture, and hope that you will be blessed as well.</p>
<p>In Job 36: 24-33 Elihu, the youngest of the men to give council to Job in the midst of his troubles, proclaims God’s Majesty. In verse 26 he declares, <em>“Behold God is Great, and we do not know Him.”</em> Elihu is making the statement that men see God’s work, but look on it from afar.  How true that still is today. The world is full of the anti-Christ spirit that would blind the minds and hearts of people from seeing and knowing the fullness of our God.</p> 
<p>In verses 29-31 he says, <em>“ Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunder from His canopy? Look, He scatters His light upon it, and covers the depths of the sea. For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance&quot;.</em> But my main point here is in verses 32 & 33 <em>“He covers His hands with lightning, and commands it to strike. ( strike the mark ) His thunder declares it, the cattle also, concerning the rising storm”</em>.</p>
<p>The majesty of His thundering voice and the lightning strikes of His hand can bring both blessings and judgment. As the children of God use His Word to proclaim, decree and declare, it goes forth with the same thundering and lightning power that hits the mark! Glory to God!</p>
<p>Job 22:28 says, <em>“You will also declare a thing, And it will be established for you: So light will shine on your ways.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Arise and Shine church, you have been given authority and power through the blood and the name of Jesus Christ. “For the people who know their God shall be strong and carry out great exploits” </strong></p>
<p>Habakkuk 3:4 says <em>“His brightness was like the light; He had rays flashing from His hand, and there His power was hidden.” </em></p>
<p>Psalm 18:13,14 says <em>“The Lord Thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire. He sent out His arrows and scattered the foe, lightnings in abundance, and He vanished them.”</em></p>
<p>He Arises and scatters His enemies <em>through us.</em> As the body of Christ we are His hands and feet in the earth today.  We are the carriers of His light (Jesus), and we can direct that light into situations, allowing that light to strike the mark. This brings forth the glory of God into any given situation, to bring blessing to the people or to do war against the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>It is the Lightnings of His Power and the Thunderings of His voice, in and through us.</strong></p>
<p>Check back soon for Part 2 of this teaching were we will answer the question: “What does Lightning and Thunder have to do with the Glory Realm?”</p>
